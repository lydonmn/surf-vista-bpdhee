You want to create a subscriber-only surf report app called SurfVista, focusing on Folly Beach, South Carolina. The app will feature high-resolution drone videos posted by you as the admin, along with automatically updated surf reports. Users will need to subscribe to view the content, and you want to be able to adjust the subscription fee. The app should be available for iOS.\n\nHere's a plan for the initial version of SurfVista:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A welcoming screen displaying the latest surf report video and a brief overview of the current conditions.\n*   **Video Library:** A section where subscribers can access archived drone videos.\n*   **Surf Report:** An automatically updated surf report section, pulling data from existing weather and surf report APIs.\n*   **Subscription/Login:** A secure login/subscription system for users to access premium content.\n*   **Admin Panel:** A hidden admin panel for you to upload videos, manage surf report data sources, and adjust the subscription fee.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F0F8FF` (AliceBlue - a light, airy blue)\n    *   Text: `#2F4F4F` (DarkSlateGray - a deep, sophisticated gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#696969` (DimGray - a muted gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#4682B4` (SteelBlue - a classic, reliable blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#B0C4DE` (LightSteelBlue - a softer shade of blue for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#FFA07A` (LightSalmon - a warm, inviting coral)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White - clean and crisp for content cards)\n    *   Highlight: `#ADD8E6` (LightBlue - a subtle highlight color)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the code changes.\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Set up the basic React Native project with Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement tab-based navigation using `react-navigation` for the main sections (Home, Video Library, Surf Report).\n3.  **Home Screen:** Create the Home screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`) to display the latest surf report video (placeholder for now) and a brief overview.\n4.  **Video Library:** Create a Video Library screen (`app/(tabs)/video/index.tsx`) with a placeholder list of videos.\n5.  **Surf Report:** Create a Surf Report screen (`app/(tabs)/surfreport/index.tsx`) and integrate a placeholder for automatically updated surf reports.\n6.  **Login/Subscription:** Implement a basic login/subscription flow using placeholder screens.\n7.  **Admin Panel:** Create a hidden admin panel (accessible via a gesture or specific route) with the ability to upload videos (placeholder), manage surf report data sources (placeholder), and adjust the subscription fee (placeholder).\n8.  **Styling:** Apply the defined color palette and typography to the app's components.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-16T00:01:09.858872"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build SurfVista, a subscriber-only surf report app!
